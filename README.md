# MkD - A Free and Opensource Markdown Editor
Hi ðŸ‘‹  
This is Vishnu. With inspiration from various online sources, I've built a markdown editor with React.

## Features
1. Live preview.
2. Support for multiple themes.
3. Can export markdown as HTML.
4. Syntax Highlighting.

## Development
First clone the repo with the command `git clone https://github.com/vishnureddys/mkd.git`. Then enter into the directory with `cd mkd`.  

Now you can install all the dependencies with `npm i`. Then to run the development server, run `npm start`.
