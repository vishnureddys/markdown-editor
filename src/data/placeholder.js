Welcome to MkD.

MkD is a simple markdown editor built with React. I've hosted this application on GitHub Pages. Feel free to contribute to this project on [GitHub](https://github.com/vishnureddys/mkd)

## What can you write here?

1. Code
  Inline code like  \`<div></div>\` or
  block code like

  \`\`\`
  npm install
  \`\`\`
The code you write here also has syntax highlighting. You can look at the python code example shown below.
\`\`\`python
import pandas as pd
a = 10
b = 20
c = a+b
\`\`\`
2. Blockquote
> You can add quotes here.

3. Different Text Style
  * **Bold**
  * *Italic*
  * ~~Strikethrough~~

4. Tables

    | Name          | Age           | Salary|
    | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
    | Vishnu        | 21            | $56000|
    | Reddy         | 24            |$120000|
    | Tommy         | 18            | $1000 |

5. Images
You can even use images in this editor. All you need is a link to that image. You can also store the images on Imgur, if privacy isn't a concern.
